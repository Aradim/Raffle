# Raffle
Very basic raffle system

This code is for internal use only. The idea is to store some tickets in different pots and have a random draw from time to time.

The code is not being planned for production, so everything is kept as simple as possible.
Things like synchronized access, error handling and logging are currently left out by design. (As such this may be currently well be called a hack. :) )
